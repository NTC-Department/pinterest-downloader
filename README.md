Ever been frustrated by Pinterest download quality and wished there was an extension that could just fix it? As a designer, I'm all about the details. So when I got tired of saving pixelated images that looked like modern art gone wrong, I decided to create this extension. It's like a little sidekick that ensures your inspiration stays sharp and crystal clear(maybe).

Nobody wants to right-click every damn pin to save mediocre quality images. Pinterest's own download feature might as well be called "How to Ruin Perfect Images". This extension fixes that issue by:

1. Adding a clean ass download button right on every pin
2. Giving you ACTUAL high-quality versions (powered by [Pinterest Image Scraper API](https://github.com/ifeiera/pinterest-scraper))
3. Being faster than explaining to your grandma why "right-click save" doesn't work

## Features

- One-click downloads from any pin page
- Instant quality selection via intuitive popup
- Fetches the best available image (subject to original quality)
- Currently supports Chrome only

> **Current Limitations**:
>
> - The extension currently supports only image pins. It does not yet support sliders, GIFs, or video pins. These features may be included in future updates.
> - Designed to work specifically on Google Chrome for now. Compatibility with other browsers may be added as the extension evolves.
> - The quality of downloaded images depends on the original upload. If the original image is low quality, the downloaded image will reflect that.

## Installation

### For Users

**Chrome Web Store** - Coming soon (once Google stops being difficult and I pay their $5 fee for publishing extensions)

**Manual Install** (for power users):

1. Download `pinterest-downloader-1.0.0-chrome.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/ifeiera/pinterest-downloader/releases)
2. Unzip the package
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable "Developer mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder
6. Test the extension by visiting this high-quality pin:
  [Business Card Mockups](https://id.pinterest.com/pin/791859547022537413/) or [Self & Others â€” Jot Press](https://id.pinterest.com/pin/1074178948624472086/) 
   - You should see the card modal appear on the right side
   - If it doesn't show up, try refreshing the page
   - This pin has been specifically chosen as it contains a high-quality original image to demonstrate the extension's capabilities

### For Developers

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [extension-repository-url]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (hot reload enabled)
npm run dev

# Build production package
npm run build
```

## How It Works

1. **Detects Pinterest URLs** - Automatically activates on Pinterest Image page
2. **Adds Card Modal** - Integrates a sleek card modal to each pin page for easy access
3. **Quality Selection Popup** - Click to choose from available resolutions
4. **Best Available Quality** - Downloads the best version available via [API](https://github.com/ifeiera/pinterest-scraper), but note that this can't improve the original image quality.

## Need the API?

This extension is powered by our [Pinterest Image Scraper API](https://github.com/ifeiera/pinterest-scraper). Self-hosters will need to set up both components.
